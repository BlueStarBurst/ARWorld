# Ourworlds!
This project is an IOS Application that creates virtual AR spaces that you can share and see at the same time with others. It uses Apple's ARWorldMapping and Anchor system however the data is stored in Firebase so I hope to make it Android compatible.

The link to the github website that allows users to upload *.glb 3D objects to storage and view on their phone is [here](https://bluestarburst.github.io/ARWorld/)

The link to the app on the Apple Appstore is [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ourworlds/id1663719945)
